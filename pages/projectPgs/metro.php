			<h2>Client, Project Definition</h2>
			<p><a href="http://citizenalummetrostate.org/" target="_blank">Metro State Citizen Alum</a> is part of the American Democracy Project. As a
				founding member and leader in implementing the project's vision,
				Metro State needed a website to meet a growing number of demands on
				the staff.</p>

			<p>My UX instructor had mentioned that Metro State needed someone to
				build a site for the school's Citizen Alum project. I asked him if I
				could make the project my capstone.</p>

			<p>After getting lots of forms signed and department approvals, I was
				allowed to tackle the project as an independent study capstone.</p>

			<h2>Design Glimpse</h2>
			<p>I met with the university stakeholders to define their business
				requirements. At first the staff only knew that they wanted the
				content available online to make their lives a bit easier.</p>

			<p>During the card sorting, participants asked me questions about the
				project. Our conversations about Citizen Alum led to a new fourth
				general category for the site's navigation.</p>

			<p>During the early testing it became obvious that showing Metro
				State's connection to the national project was a unique path that we
				did not anticipate.</p>

		<div class="showMoreLess" id="showMoreObstacle">
			<h2>A Problem or Obstacle</h2>
			<p>There were delays getting content from the university and images
				never materialized.The delays forced me to redesign the site without
				images about a quarter of the way through the project.</p>

			<p>The delays also forced me to make some judgment calls: I dropped
				some testing on the tail end of the project to ensure I could meet
				the minimum business and user criteria we had established initially.</p>

		<div class="showMoreLess" id="showMoreManage">
			<h2>Keeping It Manageable</h2>
			<p>This project was quite the undertaking for one person in a
				semester, and I broke it up into phases that could be built upon
				later.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My goal was to build the foundation that future student workers
					could easily add to in later phases.</li>

				<li class="metroLi">-The next phase will be to launch the blog of
					the alum stories.</li>

				<li class="metroLi">-The last phase will be to implement the social
					media plan that will build a community to connect and share
					resources.</li>

				<li class="metroLi">-Other improvements include monitoring
					performance metrics and SEO.</li>

		<div class="showMoreLess" id="showMoreOutcome">
			<h2>Project Outcome</h2>
			<p>We were able to meet and exceed some of the minimum business
				requirements in the project's timeframe.</p>

			<p>The staff at Metro State was amazed by the final product and how
				much I was able to accomplish by myself.</p>

			<p>During the exit interview with the project team, the director
				mentioned that he didn't realize just how valuable a CMS was until
				he saw me walk through the site.</p>
