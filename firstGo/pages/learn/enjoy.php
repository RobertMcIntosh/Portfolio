<h2>What I enjoy most</h2> 
<p>
I design and I really enjoy the process regardless of the medium. I've voided a lot of warranties from my phone to my camera flashes. 

Whenever I come across something that isn't quite right or that I could make do something more, I have a knack for looking at the root of the issue so I can discover how to make it better or simply something more. I do some research and then I crack 'er open and see what I can do. 

Testing and feedback beyond my little bubble of assumptions is probably the most exciting part of the design process to me. It's where the rubber hits the road and any and all preconceptions get tossed out the window. The promise of success or the crush of failure are all rolled up in some of those moments.  BTW, I enjoy the failures, it's were I really learn about myself and how I work. 

I love sitting with a client at the very beginning of a project, collaborating, doing research and presenting ideas and discovering what it is that they envision for a project. I know it's kinda odd for someone who for fun hacked a Kinect to be a UI for a Mac; ya know, a programmer talking and making eye contact. 

I enjoy sitting on way point between business, technology and users and I really thrive in a collaborative environment. I'd really like to be part of a team where I can be apart of the whole process.
