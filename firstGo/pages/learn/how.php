How I got here
I stumbled upon programming while earning my business degree I knew I wanted to be programmer. But I didn't know what that really meant. So, I conducted informational interviews with programmers, researched school degree descriptions and compared those findings with job postings. 

From my research I realized that there was a large gap between school degrees and the work force. That led me to Metropolitan State University to design my own degree. Yup, even designed my own degree. 

Based on my analysis and the things I enjoy, I designed my degree to be comprised of the ICS major requirements mixed with communication and design. 

I've been sneaking out of the ivy tower for few years now putting my new found knowledge to use outside academia.

As a result I've gained experience:
	hand coding programing languages and scripts
		visual communication in a variety of mediums 
		interviewing stakeholders
		establish business objectives
		creation of personas
		use case scenarios
		creation of mood board
		performing quantitative and qualitative research
	storyboarding
	prototyping 
		usability testing
		interaction design
		wireframing
		writing functional specifications
		handing in deliverables
