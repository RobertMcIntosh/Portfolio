<p>
Thanks for checking out my portfolio. IÕm usre you
noticed it's a bit different from other portfolios,
I want to highlight my process more than just stuff I've made.
It's the design process I love, not the tools.
If you're looking for a specialist who only does 'x' I'm probably not your guy.

I'm a hybrid who finds the right tool for the job at hand.
I am not the hammer that only sees nails.
Sometimes a hammer will work, but sometimes the nail needs
a saw, or pliers, or a catspaw.
The right tool depends on the job and I love my toolbox, not just one tool.
