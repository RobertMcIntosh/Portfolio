		<h2><a href="#client">Client, project definition, goals and objectives:</a></h2>
		<div id="client">
		<p>Metrostate is part of a national white house initiative citizen
			alum. As a founding member and leader in implementing the projects
			vision, Metrostate needed a website to meet a growing number of
			demands on the staff.</p>
		</div>

		<h2><a href="#glimpse">Design glimpse:</a></h2>
		<div id="glimpse">
		<p>Site navigation via persona creation I met with many of the
			university stakeholders to help define the project. The staff knew
			they wanted the content available, but I really needed to know who
			wanted the content. Through the interviews three main personas became
			very apparent. The staff at the university quickly identified three
			users: students, faculty, and alumni. From these broad categories I
			asked them for the demographics of each. Based on that info we
			created specific personas.</p>

		<p>With the persons in hand in built use case scenarios and began to
			build the site architecture in the form of 3x5 cards. With some
			gorilla testing I asked people to sort the cards based on how they
			matched one of the personas. In some case's I asked them to pretend.</p>

		<p>Durning the card sorting people asked me questions about the
			project. Our conversations about Citizen Alum led to the fourth
			general category for the sites navigation. I had thought that the use
			cases would be based solely on the persona's and the assumptions made
			during the interviews on how the users would traverse the site. But
			during the early testing it became really obvious the showing
			Metrostate's connection to the national project was a unique use case
			that we did not anticipate nor that all of the persona's could be
			interested in it. This realization led to aliing the National heading
			on the sites navigation.</p>

		<p>My big take away from this is that user's testing doesn't always
			reveal what one expects and is a good reminder to me to stay open
			minded and pay attention. It could have been really easy for me to
			disregard the conversations during testing and blinding move ahead
			with the task at hand.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2><a href="#obstacle">A Problem or obstacle:</a></h2>
		<div id="obstacle">
		<p>Through interviews with stakeholders I realized that staff and
			student workers were unfamiliar with a content management system and
			wouldn't be able to maintain the site after I completed it. I also
			learned that every semester there would be new student workers that
			would need to learn how to use the CMS.</p>

		<p>In aliition to asking the staff to watch tutorials through
			Lydia.com, I created 8 short screen capture videos that I embelied in
			PDFs to demonstrate how to do basic things that were meant to help
			jump start the staff and to help future student workers accomplish
			simple things.</p>

		<p>There were also delays getting content form the university and
			images never materialized.
		
		
		<p>These delays forced me to make some judgement calls: I dropped some
			testing on the tail end of the project to ensure I could meet the
			predefined business and user criteria we established initially I had
			to redesign the site without images, 'bout a 1/4 of the way through
			the project.</p>

		<p>This project was quite the undertaking for one person, and I broke
			it up into phases that could be built upon later. My goal was to
			build the foundation that future student workers could easily ali to
			in later phases.</p>

		<p>The next phase will be to launch the blog of the stories of alum.
			The last phase will be to implement a place for alum to build a
			community to connect and share resources. The staff is quite eager to
			start on the next phase and now they feel like it's something that
			they can actually do. They didn't before I came along.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2><a href="#outcome">Outcome:</a></h2>
		<div id="outcome">
		<p>The staff at Metrostate was amazed by the final product and they
			were very grateful for the work I did. The director mentioned that he
			didn't realize just how valuable a CMS was until he saw me walk
			through the the site.</p>
